    "This kernel is for all aspiring data scientists to learn from and to review their knowledge. We will have a detailed statistical analysis of Titanic data set along with Machine learning model implementation. I am super excited to share my first kernel with the Kaggle community. As I go on in this journey and learn new topics, I will incorporate them with each new updates. So, check for them and please <b>leave a comment</b> if you have any suggestions to make them better!! Going back to the topics of this kernel, I will do more in-depth visualizations to explain the data, and the machine learning classifiers will be used to predict passenger survival status. So, let's get started.\n",

Now, how do we know what we are teaching is what they are learning? That is where the test set comes to play. We withhold part of the data where we know the output/result of the algorithms, and we use this data to test the trained machine learning model.

This theory aligns with one other correlation which is the correlation between Fare and Pclass(-0.6). This relationship can be explained by saying that first class passenger(1) paid more for fare then second class passenger(2), similarly second class passenger paid more than the third class passenger(3). This theory can also be supported by mentioning another Pclass correlation with our dependent variable, Survived. The correlation between Pclass and Survived is -0.33.

However, when we do statistical tests, we get a scientific or mathematical perspective of how significant these results are. Let's apply some of these methods and see how we are doing with our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Hypothesis Testing Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test compares the mean of a control group and experimental group and tries to find out whether the two sample means are different from each other and if they are different, how significant that difference is.\n",
    " \n",
    "A **hypothesis test** usually consists of multiple parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate a well-developed research problem or question: The hypothesis test usually starts with a concrete and well-developed researched problem. We need to ask the right question that can be answered using statistical analyses. \n",
    "2. The null hypothesis($H_0$) and Alternating hypothesis($H_1$):\n",
    "> * The **null hypothesis($H_0$)** is something that is assumed to be true. It is the status quo. In a null hypothesis, the observations are the result of pure chance. When we set out to experiment, we form the null hypothesis by saying that there is no difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group.\n",
    "> *  An **Alternative hypothesis($H_A$)** is a claim and the opposite of the null hypothesis.  It is going against the status quo. In an alternative theory, the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Determine the **test statistic**: test statistic can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. Depending on the standard deviation we either use t-statistics or z-statistics. In addition to that, we want to identify whether the test is a one-tailed test or two-tailed test. [This](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/basic-statistics/supporting-topics/basics/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/) article explains it pretty well. [This](https://stattrek.com/hypothesis-test/hypothesis-testing.aspx) article is pretty good as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specify a **Significance level**: The significance level($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, we are ***comfortable/confident*** with rejecting the null hypothesis a significant amount of times even though it is true. This considerable amount is our Significant level. In addition to that significance level is one minus our Confidence interval. For example, if we say, our significance level is 5%, then our confidence interval would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 or 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compute the **T-statistics**: Computing the t-statistics follows a simple equation. This equation slightly differs depending on one sample test or two sample test  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Compute the **P-value**: P-value is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. The p-value is known to be unintuitive, and even many professors are known to explain it wrong. I think this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4KCfcVwzyw) explains the p-value well. **The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Describe the result and compare the p-value with the significance value($\\alpha$)**: If p<=$\\alpha$, then the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid. However if the p> $\\alpha$, we say that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even though this sentence is grammatically wrong, it is logically right. We never accept the null hypothesis just because we are doing the statistical test with sample data points.\n",

    "Now, we have to understand that those two means are not  **the population mean ($\\bar{\\mu}$)**.  *The population mean is a statistical term statistician uses to indicate the actual average of the entire group. The group can be any gathering of multiple numbers such as animal, human, plants, money, stocks.* For example, To find the age population mean of Bulgaria; we have to account for every single person's age and take their age. Which is almost impossible and if we were to go that route; there is no point of doing statistics in the first place. Therefore we approach this problem using sample sets. The idea of using sample set is that; if we take multiple samples of the same population and take the mean of them and put them in a distribution; eventually the distribution start to look more like a **normal distribution**. The more samples we take and the more sample means will be added and, the closer the normal distribution will reach towards population mean. This is where **Central limit theory** comes from. We will go more in depth of this topic later on. \n",

We will use the sampling distribution approach to do the test. let's take 50 random sample of male and female from our train data."

Let us describe the previous sentence a bit more for clarification. I am going to use [this post](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/what-is-a-t-test-and-why-is-it-like-telling-a-kid-to-clean-up-that-mess-in-the-kitchen) as reference to describe the t-statistics here. \n",

    "So, according to the explanation above, the t-value or t-statistics is basically measures the strength of the signal(the difference) to the amount of noise(the variation) in the data and that is how we calculate the t-value in one sample t-test. However, in order to calculate between two sample population mean or in our case we will use the follow equation. \n",

    "So, we have our first model and its score. But, how do we make sure that our model is performing well. Our model may be overfitting or underfitting. In fact, for those of you don't know what overfitting and underfitting is, Let's find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fittings.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see in the chart above. **Underfitting** is when the model fails to capture important aspects of the data and therefore introduces more bias and performs poorly. On the other hand, **Overfitting** is when the model performs too well on the training data but does poorly in the validation set or test sets.  This situation is also known as having less bias but more variation and perform poorly as well. Ideally, we want to configure a model that performs well not only in the training data but also in the test data. This is where **bias-variance tradeoff** comes in. When we have a model that overfits, meaning less biased and more of variance, we introduce some bias in exchange of having much less variance. One particular tactic for this task is regularization models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net).  These models are built to deal with the bias-variance tradeoff. This [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting) explains this topic well. Also, the following chart gives us a mental picture of where we want our models to be. \n",
    "![](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/docs/BiasVariance/biasvariance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to pick a sweet spot where the model performs well in training set, validation set, and test set. As the model gets complex, bias decreases, variance increases. However, the most critical part is the error rates. We want our models to be at the bottom of that **U** shape where the error rate is the least. That sweet spot is also known as **Optimum Model Complexity(OMC).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what we want in terms of under-fitting and over-fitting, let's talk about how to combat them. \n",

    "**Gridsearch** is a simple concept but effective technique in Machine Learning. The word **GridSearch** stands for the fact that we are searching for optimal parameter/parameters over a \"grid.\" These optimal parameters are also known as **Hyperparameters**. **The Hyperparameters are model parameters that are set before fitting the model and determine the behavior of the model.**. For example, when we choose to use linear regression, we may decide to add a penalty to the loss function such as Ridge or Lasso. These penalties require specific alpha (the strength of the regularization technique) to set beforehand. The higher the value of alpha, the more penalty is being added. GridSearch finds the optimal value of alpha among a range of values provided by us, and then we go on and use that optimal value to fit the model and get sweet results. It is essential to understand those model parameters are different from models outcomes, for example, **coefficients** or model evaluation metrics such as **accuracy score** or **mean squared error** are model outcomes and different than hyperparameters.\n",

RF is an ensemble method (combination of many decision trees) which is where the \"forest\" part comes in. One crucial details about Random Forest is that while using a forest of decision trees, RF model <b>takes random subsets of the original dataset(bootstrapped)</b> and <b>random subsets of the variables(features/columns)</b>. Using this method, the RF model creates 100's-1000's(the amount can be menually determined) of a wide variety of decision trees. This variety makes the RF model more effective and accurate. We then run each test data point through all of these 100's to 1000's of decision trees or the RF model and take a vote on the output. \n",

    "Bagging works best with strong and complex models(for example, fully developed decision trees). However, don't let that fool you to thinking that similar to a decision tree, bagging also overfits the model. Instead, bagging reduces overfitting since a lot of the sample training data are repeated and used to create base estimators. With a lot of equally likely training data, bagging is not very susceptible to overfitting with noisy data, therefore reduces variance. However, the downside is that this leads to an increase in bias."

    "AdaBoost is another <b>ensemble model</b> and is quite different than Bagging. Let's point out the core concepts. \n",
    "> AdaBoost combines a lot of \"weak learners\"(they are also called stump; a tree with only one node and two leaves) to make classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This base model fitting is an iterative process where each stump is chained one after the other; <b>It cannot run in parallel.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>Some stumps get more say in the final classifications than others.</b> The models use weights that are assigned to each data point/raw indicating their \"importance.\" Samples with higher weight have a higher influence on the total error of the next model and gets more priority. The first stump starts with uniformly distributed weight which means, in the beginning, every datapoint have an equal amount of weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>Each stump is made by talking the previous stump's mistakes into account.</b> After each iteration weights gets re-calculated in order to take the errors/misclassifications from the last stump into consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The final prediction is typically constructed by a weighted vote where weights for each base model depends on their training errors or misclassification rates. \n",
    "\n",

    "> <b>First</b>, we determine the best feature to split the dataset using Gini index(basics from decision tree). The feature with the lowest Gini index becomes the first stump in the AdaBoost stump chain(the lower the Gini index is, the better unmixed the label is, therefore, better split).\n",
    "***\n",
    "> <b>Secondly</b>, we need to determine how much say a stump will have in the final classification and how we can calculate that.\n",
    "* We learn how much say a stump has in the final classification by calculating how well it classified the samples (aka calculate the total error of the weight).\n",
    "* The <b>Total Error</b> for a stump is the sum of the weights associated with the incorrectly classified samples. For example, lets say, we start a stump with 10 datasets. The first stump will uniformly distribute an weight amoung all the datapoints. Which means each data point will have 1/10 weight. Let's say once the weight is distributed we run the model and find 2 incorrect predicitons. In order to calculate the total erorr we add up all the misclassified weights. Here we get 1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10 or 1/5. This is our total error. We can also think about it\n",
    "### $$ \\epsilon_t = \\frac{\\text{misclassifications}_t}{\\text{observations}_t} $$\n",
    "* Since the weight is uniformly distributed(all add up to 1) among all data points, the total error will always be between 0(perfect stump) and 1(horrible stump).\n",
    "* We use the total error to determine the amount of say a stump has in the final classification using the following formula\n",
    " \n",
    "### $$ \\alpha_t = \\frac{1}{2}ln \\left(\\frac{1-\\epsilon_t}{\\epsilon_t}\\right) \\text{where } \\epsilon_t < 1$$\n",
